# Deadlift-Tracking-App
This project uses Scikit-Learn, mediapipe, and Tkinter to create a machine learning application that tracks deadlifts.

It is inspired by Nicholas Renotte's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaBy3X37Oa8

The app also uses a pickle file containing the model and a file containing landmarks obtained from Nicholas Renotte's github repo for the project.

The pickle file requires Scikit-Learn version 1.1.2, which requires Python 3.7 - Python 3.10.
